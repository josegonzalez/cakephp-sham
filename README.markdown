## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x

## Installation

_[Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)]_

[View on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/josegonzalez/cakephp-sham), and copy the json snippet for the latest version into your project's `composer.json`. Eg, v. 1.0.0 would look like this:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "josegonzalez/cakephp-sham": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in it's own `composer.json`, composer knows to install it inside your `/Plugins` directory, rather than in the usual vendors file. It is recommended that you add `/Plugins/Sham` to your .gitignore file. (Why? [read this](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).)

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [https://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-sham/zipball/master](https://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-sham/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `Sham`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

    git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-sham.git Plugin/Sham
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type

    git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-sham.git Sham

### Enable plugin

Before using, you MUST enable the plugin:

    CakePlugin::load('Sham');

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();` before usage, then this is not necessary.

## Usage

Add the component and helper to your AppController `$components` and `$helpers` arrays:

```php
<?php
class AppController extends Controller {
    public $components = array('Sham.Sham');
    public $helpers = array('Sham.Sham');
}
?>
```

By default, Sham does not automatically load SEO data from the database. You should create callbacks in your controllers to do that. Callbacks are on a per-action basis, with `_seo` prepending the name of the action, where the first letter of the action is upper-cased:

```php
<?php
class UsersController extends AppController {

    public function profile($username = null) {
        // Some code that works with user profiles
    }

    public function _seoProfile() {
        // Called in the beforeRender() if the action was successfully processed
        $user = $this->viewVars['user'];
        $this->Sham->loadBySlug('view/' . $user['User']['username']);

        // Set some defaults in case the record could not be loaded from the DB
        $description = "awesome description of the page, with some good default keywords, referencing {$user['User']['username']}";
        $keywords = array($user['User']['username'] . ' profile', 'profiles', 'social network');

        $this->Sham->setMeta('title', "{$user['User']['username']}'s Profile  | Social Network");
        $this->Sham->setMeta('description', $description);
        $this->Sham->setMeta('keywords', implode(', ', $keywords));
        $this->Sham->setMeta('canonical', "/view/{$user['User']['username']}/", array('escape' => false));
    }
}
?>
```

If you do not have a callback for a given action, there is always the option of specifying a "fallback" method. This is configurable in the components settings, but is `Controller::_seoFallback()` by default:

```php
<?php
class AppController extends Controller {
    public $components = array('Sham.Sham');
    public $helpers = array('Sham.Sham');

    public function _seoFallback() {
        // ... code ...
    }
}
?>
```

Once you've loaded seo data, it's time to set it for the view. Included is a `ShamHelper` which automatically will deal with these details:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <?php echo $this->Sham->out('charset'); ?>
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
        <?php echo $this->Sham->out(null, array('skip' => array('charset'))); ?>
        <?php echo $this->Html->css(array('style', 'uniform.default')); ?>
    <head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, we can call individual SEO information - in this case the charset - if necessary, and then call the rest by passing `null` as an option to the helper. This is useful in some cases where you might need to have the SEO data in a specific order.

## Todo

* Document Helper and Component options
